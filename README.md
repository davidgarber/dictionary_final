Description
-----------

Dictionary allows the user to enter words and subsequent definitions.

Set Up
------

Begin by opening up the word folder in Atom.

Open up the terminal and change directory to the word folder.

Type: ruby app.rb

Once Sinatra has taken the stage, open your browser and proceed
to localhost:4567.

Click on "Add a new word."

After adding the word you can "See the word list", "Add a new word" or
"Return to the Main Page."

If I get it to work in the next 45 minutes, you will be able to click
on the word and add a definition.
